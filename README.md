# RayleighLordAnimations

In this repository I will share the source code of some of my animations. My goal is for each animation to be self-contained and explained in a way that not only the process of creating the animation is understood but the process of computing the physics and math of each problem too.

I am working on a library that makes many tasks repeatable. The idea is to easily produce high quality animations using matplotlib, which is a very well documented library and continuously improving.

For other resources, check the library manim, which is the one 3Blue1Brown uses for his excellent videos.

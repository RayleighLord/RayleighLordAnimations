# RayleighLordAnimations

In this repository I will share the source code of some of my animations. My goal is for each animation to be self-contained and explained in a way that not only the process of creating the animation is understood but the process of computing the physics and math of each problem too.

I am working on a library that makes many tasks repeatable. The idea is to easily produce high quality animations using matplotlib, which is a very well documented library and continiously improving. This library will be more complex in terms of python knowledge needed than the animations shown here and will take some time.

For other resources, check the library manim, which is the one 3Blue1Brown uses for his excellent videos.
